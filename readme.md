# Simply paid

Simple and secure payment service between people. Side project made to get hands dirty in back-end development with node and typescript.

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies

- `Node@20.0.9`
- `Typescript@5.3.3`
- `Vitest@1.2.1`

## How to run it

Using docker:

- **Build the Docker Image**: After creating the Dockerfile, you can build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t simply-paid .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag (-t) the image with the name "simply-paid".

- **Run the Docker Container**: Once the image has been built, you can run it as a container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d simply-paid
```

This command tells Docker to run a container from the "simply-paid" image, map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 of the host machine, and run the container in detached mode (-d).

## ðŸ’­ How it was built

First of all, after a slow and patient reading through the requirements, I got to understand what is the purpose of the project. Then I started some sketches to plan what I had to do and write some tests about the use cases.
